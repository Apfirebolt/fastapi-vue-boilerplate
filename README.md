## Tech Stack

The project back-end is created using Fast API in Python and Vue is used for the front-end. Front-end and back-end components are containerized into docker
containers.

## Introduction

A simple boilerplate app, might be extended in future to add more features and modules both at front-end and back-end.

## Deployment

Can be deployed on a VPS with Docker installed using Docker containers. Below is a detailed explanation of the Docker compose file used in this project with three services.

```
version: '3.9'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: fastapi-server
    container_name: fast-container
    command: python main.py
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    networks:
      - fast-network
    volumes:
      - ./:/usr/src/app/
  
  nginx:
    container_name: fast-nginx
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    depends_on:
      - app
    networks:
      - fast-network

  
  client:
    build:
      context: ./client
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: app-client
    container_name: app-vue-client
    volumes:
      - ./client/:/usr/app/client
      - /usr/app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - fast-network

networks:
    fast-network:
        driver: bridge
```

First service is called app which is a back-end service using Fast API. Fast API serves the build generated by the client service which is a Vue app spawned using Vite. Finally, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy to redirect all the requests on port 80 to port 8000 which is the default port exposed by Fast API.

These services are internally connected through a Docker network named 'fast-network'. The containers which are part of the same network can access each other using the app names defined in the Docker-compose file. For instance, take the below example :-

#### Nginx Conf file

```
upstream app {
    server app:8000;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://app;
    }
}
```

The nginx conf file can access fast-API application through 'app' which was defined as the app-name for the back-end service written in Fast API.
